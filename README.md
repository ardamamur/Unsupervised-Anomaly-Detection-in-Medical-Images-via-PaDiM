## Project Abstract
PaDiM, to concurrently detect and localize anomalies
in images in a one-class learning setting. PaDiM makes use
of a pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) for patch
embedding, and of multivariate Gaussian distributions to get a
probabilistic representation of the normal class. It also exploits
correlations between the different semantic levels of CNN to
better localize anomalies. PaDiM outperforms current state-ofthe-art approaches for both anomaly detection and localization
on the MVTec AD and STC datasets. To match real-world visual
industrial inspection, we extend the evaluation protocol to assess
performance of anomaly localization algorithms on non-aligned
dataset. The state-of-the-art performance and low complexity of
PaDiM make it a good candidate for many industrial applications.
